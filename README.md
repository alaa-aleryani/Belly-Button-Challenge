# Belly_Button_Challenge

## Background
In this challenge, I had to build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called `operational taxonomic units`, or **`OTUs`**, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Instructions
1. I used D3 library to the `samples.json` file from the given URL (https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json).

2. Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display teh top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
    - Used `sample_values` as the values fo rthe bar chart.
    - Used `otu_ids` as the labels for the bar chart.
    - Used `otu_labels` as the hovertext for the chart.

3. Created a bubble chart that displays each sample:
    - Used `otu_ids` for the x values.
    - Used `sample_values` for the y values.
    - Used `sample_values` for the marker size.
    - Used `otu-ids` for the marker colors.
    - Used `otu_labels` for the text values.

4. Displayed the sample metadata, i.e, an indivdual's demographic information.

5. Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object.

6. Updated all the plots when a new sample is selected.
